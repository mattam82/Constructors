(** Constructors - An example plugin and tactic for Coq

    This defines a tactic [constructors of c in id] that puts
    the list of constructors of the inductive type [c] in the
    (fresh) hypothesis [id]. We build a [list dynamic] where
    [dyn] is defined in a support file of the plugin
    (in theories/Dynamic.v) and is isomorphic to a sigma type.
